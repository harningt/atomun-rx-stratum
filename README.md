## Versioning

This library will follow the guidelines set forth in [Semantic Versioning 2.0][SemVer2.0]

Public APIs not marked with @Beta are considered under the purview of the versioning rules.

@Beta items follow the attached documentation to the annotation, shortly put:

the versioning rules.

## License

This library is covered under the [Apache 2.0 license][Apache2.0] as indicated in the LICENSE file.

## Repository Details

The repository is managed using the Gitflow workflow. Note that any published
feature/* branches are subject to history modification, so beware working
off of those.

Non-annotated tags will be added in the form vMAJOR.MINOR.MICRO-dev to denote the
start of a new feature. This will guide the next release to be versioned as
vMAJOR.MINOR.MICRO. Without this, the next expected version would be a MICRO-change.

Signed and annotated tags will be added in the form vMAJOR.MINOR.MICRO to denote
releases.

## Release Signing

Releases will be signed by the following privately held GPG key. It doesn't
get published to Travis-CI.

    pub   2048R/F8908096 2014-10-29
          Key fingerprint = B6CC 560D F1C0 991E 08AA  555A ED63 F369 F890 8096
    uid                  Thomas Harning Jr (CODE SIGNING KEY) <harningt@gmail.com>

## Snapshot Signing

Snapshots will be signed by a key held by Travis-CI in their encrypted
data stores. I figured it would be better to sign the snapshots than not
have them signed at all, even if the specific key is less protected.

          Key fingerprint = FCA2 D4CC 9294 38B7 5B91  8D9E 6BF2 A2D1 EF39 E8D8
    uid                  Thomas Harning Jr (AUTOMATED CI CODESIGNER) <harningt@gmail.com>
